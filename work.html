                <h2>Budget Application</h2>
                <p>
                    This project creates a running budget for the user. This project came with a HTML and CSS design that I was to add JavaScript to make it functional with no edits to HTML or CSS files. This application comes with the ability to add either an income or an expense as well as track the ongoing total of the two. Note: this was a guided project. Added features outside the guided portion include: alerts user when they are over budget, proper commas will be added no matter how large the number, user can edit any portion of their entry by clicking on the value to edit.

                <p>
                    This project was build from bootstraps and jQuery. Includes pulling from an external API to get data about pokémon to display to the user. Data is displayed in a modal when pokémon's name is clicked. Includes functionality to change between descriptions using 'next' and 'previous' buttons.

                <p>
                    In this project, I was given a basic HTML and CSS structure. I had to create a page capable of taking the data entered by the user and put it into a table without editing the HTML or CSS originally given. Added features include: auto-correct of subject if entered incorrectly or mispelled, a 'late' button which will take 10 points off any assignment if not 'on-time', running GPA for all subjects as well as individual subjects, and the ability to make changes to any entered information by clicking on the part you wish to change. (Note for this feature it will update GPA and subject GPA accordingly as well).

                <h2>The Pig Game</h2>
                <p>
                    Created the classic Pig Game through manipulation of JavaScript. Game will allow user to roll a dice as many times as they like, adding their total to the current category. At any time they may stop and add the current score to their total score, ending their turn. If they roll a 1, the current score returns to 0 and their turn is ended. Set to two players and the first to 100 points wins.

                <h2>Match Game</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was a simple activity using JavaScript to manipulate HTML and CSS. The user may hit any key shown on the webpage to display the animal hidden under the 'card'. If the user finds two matching animals, they win the game. Currently set to give the user 4 button pushes before the game is over and resets as well as will automatically reset if the user wins after displaying they won.

                <p>
                    Basic project using JavaScript to create a random number between 1-20 and allow the user to guess the number. Set to let the user know how close the first guess was to the correct random number as well as additional guess telling the user if they are hotter or colder from their inital guess. Game set to reset after alerting the user they have won.
